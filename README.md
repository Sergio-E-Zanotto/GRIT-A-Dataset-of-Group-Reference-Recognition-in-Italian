# GRIT-A-Dataset-of-Group-Reference-Recognition-in-Italian
We introduce GRIT (Group Reference for Italian), a large-scale, multi-domain manually annotated dataset for group reference recognition in Italian. 
GRIT represents a new resource for automatic and generalizable recognition of group references. With this dataset, we aim to establish group reference recognition (GRR) as a valid classification task, which extends the domain of Named Entity Recognition by expanding its focus to literal and figurative mentions of social groups.
