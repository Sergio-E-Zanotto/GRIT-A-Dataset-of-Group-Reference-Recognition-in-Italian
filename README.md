## Overview

- **Purpose**: To lead the development of GRR as a distinct classification task, enhancing the scope of Named Entity Recognition.
- **Features**: Large-scale, multi-domain, manually annotated.
- **Goal**: Establishing a benchmark for automatic group reference recognition in Italian, facilitating research and development in linguistic analysis and natural language processing.

Explore GRIT to uncover insights into social group dynamics in Italian texts.
